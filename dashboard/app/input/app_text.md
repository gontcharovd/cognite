**Data**

Data is obtained from [Cognite Open Industrial Data](https://openindustrialdata.com/about/).
It originates from the first-stage compressor on Aker BPâ€™s Valhall oil platform in the North Sea.
The app allows to visualize one-minute pressure readings of seven sensors situated around the compressor.

**Features**

* select a date range up to 60 days ago
* select two sensors
* inspect the pressure difference
* the flowsheet highlights the sensor location

**Technology**

This application is developed in R and Shiny and is deployed on a virtual machine on Google Cloud.
The data is queried from a PostgreSQL database. Every day at midnight, new pressure readings are
written to the database through a data pipeline built with Apache Airflow.
